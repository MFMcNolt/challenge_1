# Week1 Challenge

## Description

This project was challenging me as a web developer to experience an on-the-job task that will be presented to me as a web developer in a work place. The marketing agency requested a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site is optimized for search engines.

I learnt how to understand semantic HTML elements, the Scout Rule, refactoring, accessibilty oportunities for a webpage, the importance of sequential ordering with HTML and how to utilize ChromeDev to amend CSS.
